<h2><center>HD Cookbook Errata, Ch. 15-23</center></h2>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>
<b>Page 16-1, paragraph 2</b>:&nbsp;
The text indicates that the name &quot;Xlet&quot; was copied into the 
mobile phone/CLDC space.  In fact, the xlet <i>model</i> was copied
into this space, but it was renamed &quot;Midlet&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<b>Page 16-2 paragraph 2</b>:&nbsp;
The text indicates there are no classloaders in CLDC.  This is imprecise;
in fact, there are system classloaders in CLDC, but no application classloaders
as are found in CDC and desktop Java.
</p>

<p>
<b>Page 16-11, sample code 16.4</b>:&nbsp;
A local variable <code>c</code> is used to hold the 
<code>PlaybackControl</code>, rather
than assigning it to the instance variable 
<code>playackControl</code> declared in sample code 16.3.  Similarly,
an undeclared variable <code>p</code> is assumed to contain an instance
of Player; the instance variable <code>ourPlayer</code> declared in 16.3
should have been used instead.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<p>
<b>Page 17-3, sample code 17.2</b>:&nbsp;
The variables <code>ht</code> and <code>hst</code> should both
be <code>t</code>, the variable
<code>factory</code> should be <code>fact</code>, and the
variable <code>mc</code> should be <code>myComponent</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Page 17-11, sample code 17.8</b>:&nbsp;
The title is incorrect, and should be &quot;Loading a sound using
the <code>HSound</code> API&quot;
</p>

<p>
<b>Page 17-12, sample code 17.9</b>:&nbsp;
The call to <code>redraw()</code> should be to <code>repaint()</code>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<p>
<b>Page 19-4, Sample Code 19.2</b>:&nbsp;
In the import statement at the top,
<code>org.havi.ui.HKeyCapabilities</code>
should be
<code>org.havi.ui.event.HRcCapabilities</code>.
<p>
<b>Page 19-5, Sample Code 19.2</b>:&nbsp;
The return type of the method <code>getKeyHue(int)</code>
should be <code>float</code>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<p>
<b>Page 20-4, paragraph 4</b>:&nbsp;
The two sentences at the end of the paragraph should be removed.
They are, &quot;<strike>There is another control in <code>org.bluray.media</code>
called <code>AsynchronousPiPControl</code>, but it has proven to be
somewhat problematic in practice.  It is not discussed here.</strike>&quot; 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<p>
<b>Page 21-2, paragraph 2</b>:&nbsp;
The system property <code>org.bluray.vfs.root</code> should be
<code>bluray.vfs.root</code>.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<b>Page 23-11, Sample Code 23.4</b>:&nbsp;
The to segment definitions incorrectly have a open-brace ("{")
after the segment name.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DVD Included in Book</h2>

<p>
<h3>Book Disc Image Doesn't Work</h3>
<p>
The BD disc image and code on the DVD has had a number of bugfixes
and enhancements since the publication of the book.  Two are of
particular note:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The jarsigner tool had a bug in JAR signing that will cause
        the menu xlet to not run on newer versions of players, such
	as software player versions that have come out since the book's
	publication.  This bug has been fixed.
    <li>The need to strip the "CPI bits" out of the transport stream to
        enable playback on a consumer PS/3, and other valid players was
	discovered.  Thus, a version of the transport streams with these
	bits set false is now available.
</ul>
<p>
To get the latest version, you'll need the "subversion" source code
management system installed on your computer.  Go
to 
<a href="https://hdcookbook.dev.java.net">https://hdcookbook.dev.java.net</a>.
First, grab
the disc image 2007_10_hdcookbook_disc_image_no_jar_no_bdjo.zip
from under the "documents and files" link.  This has the CPI bit
set to false in the video stream.  Then,
bring over the subversion repository (click on "subversion" on the
right).  You'll need to set a couple of variables to point to the
platform stubs, and to the place you want the JAR and BDJO files to be
installed -- look at vars.properties, which tells you how to override
them in user.vars.properties.
